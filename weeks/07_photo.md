## Homework Week07

- Option 1: continue working on past homework

- Option 2: create an app to access or manipulate photos

  - you can base it on one of the resources presented in class, adding your own twist

- create a Week07 folder for your project and add link to it here:

  - [wiki home page week07](https://github.com/molab-itp/content-2025-09/wiki#week-07-homework)

  - update your wiki page with your
    - progress,
    - problems,
    - plans, and
    - questions
