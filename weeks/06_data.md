# Week 06 Local Data 2, More SwiftUI

## [[Previous](./05_data.md)] [[Next](./07_photo.md)]

## Plan

- review homework

- break

- review demos

## SwiftUI Demos

Examples of using data, typically stored as JSON, to describe the navigational layout of views.

- [iDine app](https://github.com/molab-itp/06-iDine)
  "restaurant app that lists items in a menu and helps folks place orders"

  - [source repo](https://github.com/twostraws/iDine)
  - [hackingwithswift.com swiftui-tutorial](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/swiftui-tutorial-building-a-complete-project)

## In Class Exercise

- Use the Router model for naviation
- Based on:

  - [03-ImageUiDemo-2-urls](https://github.com/molab-itp/03-ImageUiDemo-2-urls)
  - renaming and remixing Xcode project | recommended steps
  - [06-Router](https://github.com/molab-itp/06-Router)
    - Replaces NavigationView with Router @Observable class PageModel

- build BasicNav
  - from Build from Page9 [03-ImageUiDemo-1-symbols](https://github.com/molab-itp/03-ImageUiDemo-1-symbols)
  - add [03-UIGraphics-View](https://github.com/molab-itp/03-UIGraphics-View)
  - add PlayAudioView from [04-Audio-State-Demo](https://github.com/molab-itp/04-Audio-State-Demo)
