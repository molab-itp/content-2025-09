## In Class Exercises

### Terminal basics

- Use Terminal to clone [course wiki](https://github.com/molab-itp/content-2025-09/wiki)

```
# script to clone the class wiki
# enter in Terminal app

# select location of wiki
cd ~/Documents

# clone local copy of wiki
git clone https://github.com/molab-itp/content-2025-09.wiki.git

# basic commands

cd ~
ls -la

# setup for useful alias

code ~/.zshrc
alias ll='ls -l -a'
alias og='open -a /Applications/GitHub\ Desktop.app'
source ~/.zshrc

```

### global .gitignore

```

# keep unneeded files out of repo

# create global .gitignore in user home directory
cd ~
code .gitignore
.DS_Store
**/xcuserdata/
node_modules

```

### Overview

- Create your class github repo
- Use xcode to create a playground
- Post a link to your class work on the homework page.

### Steps

- create a github account if you don't already have one

- email me your github username
- you will be added to the course molab-itp organization so that you can edit the wiki in the next step

- check for invite to molab-itp organization

- opt-in to public exposure,
  pick your [nom de plume / pen name / pseudonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_name)
  for your [student wiki page](https://github.com/molab-itp/content-2025-09/wiki)
- add your student wiki page and write:

  - what programming languages have you used? how much?
  - what is your favorite mobile app and why?
  - if you have a concept for a final project write a short description
  -

- use github desktop to clone these repos:

  - [01-Javascript-to-Swift](https://github.com/molab-itp/01-Javascript-to-Swift)
  - [01-Playground](https://github.com/molab-itp/01-Playground)

- create a git repo for your class work, name it **molab-2025-09-yourNickName**

  - make sure README.md option is checked
  - add **jht9629-nyu** as a collaborator

- add a folder named **Week01** to store this week's work

- use Xcode to create a playground in folder **Week01** of your repo
- copy one for pages of sample code to your playground

- commit and push the updates to your repo

- add a link to your playground on [wiki home page](https://github.com/molab-itp/content-2025-09/wiki#week-01-homework)

## Homework Week01

start in class

- budget 6 to 9 hours for your homework assignments
- depending on your prior coding experience you may need less time
- focus on completing as much of Part 1 - swift fundamentals as possible
<!-- - the goal is to complete up to Day 14 by Week 3 of this course -->
- the goal is to complete swift fundatmentals by week 3

develop a plan to learn swift programming fundamentals over the next 2 - 3 weeks.

pick an option for learning swift programming fundamentals:

option 1:

- [the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/)

option 2:

- [Days 1 to 14 of 100 days of swiftui](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

option 3:

- [linkedin swift-5-essential-training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/swift-5-essential-training)

option 4:

- kodeco.com
- [swift-fundamentals](https://www.kodeco.com/28092971-programming-in-swift-fundamentals)
- [swift-functions-types](https://www.kodeco.com/28433240-programming-in-swift-functions-types)

### Part 1 - begin study of swift fundamentals

- for example: do Days 1 to 7 of [100 days of swiftui](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
- document hours and issues in your wiki page

### Part 2 - create a playground that produces text art

- demonstrate use of variables, for-loops, and functions
- example: [01-Playground generative random](https://github.com/molab-itp/01-Playground/blob/main/01-Playground.playground/Pages/generative%20random.xcplaygroundpage/Contents.swift)
- store the playground in your classwork repo in folder Week01 and update the repo

- add a link to your playground on the [wiki home page](https://github.com/molab-itp/content-2025-09/wiki#week-01-homework)

- document issues/errors in comments
- save source of any errors

## [Next](./02_swift.md)

<!--
- review the Swift resources
- select resource(s) for learning Swift programming fundamentals
- write a brief summary of your plan on your wiki page
- and note what resources you plan to use
- be prepare to discuss in class your impressions of the swift learning resources that you used
- it is OK to revise your plan as you go
-
