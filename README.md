# [content-2025-01 Mobile App Development Lab](https://github.com/molab-itp/content-2025-01)

One of the most transformative consumer products in history, the iPhone remains
the standard bearer for great design and user experience. With the latest
versions of iOS and iPhone, Apple puts depth sensing and augmented reality in
our pockets. How do we take advantage of this incredible platform to produce our
own compelling experiences?

This course will be a hands-on workshop where we explore the world beyond
generic apps and push the boundaries of what's possible on iOS hardware. Each
week, you'll be asked to complete a programming exercise meant to foster your
understanding of iOS application development. We'll leverage existing open source
libraries to quickly build out your app with features such as
real time communication and cloud storage.

We aim to create distributed instruments for computed expression.

Full-time access to an iOS device and a Mac laptop computer
running the latest operating system and development tools are required.

A modern mac laptop computer with ample free hard drive space (100Gig)
is recommended to run Xcode efficiently.

Prereq:
Some programming experience (such as ICM) and willingness to learn Apple's Swift programming language.

## Statement of Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks or from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else. In the case of code, plagiarism is to present as your own code written by someone else without attribution or citing the source of the code.

Collaboration is highly valued and often necessary to produce great work. Students build their own work on that of other people and giving credit to the creator of the work you are incorporating into your own work is an act of integrity. Plagiarism, on the other hand, is a form of fraud. Proper acknowledgment and correct citation constitute the difference.

## Statement of Principle

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members. It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice. Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards. For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the [Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook](http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html).

## Statement on Accessibility

It’s crucial for our community to create and uphold learning environments that empower students of all abilities. We are committed to create an environment that enables open dialogue about the various temporary and long term needs of students and participants for their academic success. We encourage all students and participants to discuss with faculty and staff possible accommodations that would best support their learning. Students may also contact the Moses Center for Student Accessibility (212-998-4980) for resources and support.

## Statement on Counseling and Wellness

Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. Emphasizing the importance of the wellness of each individual within our community, students are encouraged to utilize the resources and support services available to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via the NYU Wellness Exchange Hotline at 212-443-9999. Additional support is available over email at wellness.exchange@nyu.edu and within the NYU Wellness Exchange app.

## Statement on use of Electronic Devices

Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations. Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.
